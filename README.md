# IMiGEr
Interactive Multimodal Graph Explorer

IMiGer is graph exploration platform allowing faster graph structure understanding by advanced interctivity, unique edge hiding and grouping concepts. Users are able to create a mental model of data visualized much faster compared to traditional graph visualalization tools.

The program is able to display various types of  graphs,  which  is  enabled  by  generalized  [input graph  structure](https://github.com/ReliSA/IMiGEr/blob/devel/documents/IMiGEr/IMiGEr_raw_input_format.pdf).   It  is  able  to  handle  multiple  types of  both  nodes  and  edge.   Thus  it  can  be suitable for the visualization of  any graph  data  which  could  be  converted  to the given  generalized structure (e.g. software engineering projects, intelligence  agencies  analysis,  historical  data,  computer  networks,  social networks).  

The program is deployed at http://relisa-dev.kiv.zcu.cz:8085/imiger (use Chromium-based browsers please, functionality not guaranteed in Firefox).
